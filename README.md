# Clustering Assignment using PyCaret

This repository contains the implementation of different clustering algorithms on the Iris dataset using PyCaret. The goal is to explore the performance of clustering techniques with various pre-processing methods and evaluate them on different metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this assignment is the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each belonging to one of three species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica). The dataset contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Clustering Techniques

1. **K Means Clustering**
2. **Hierarchical Clustering**

## Evaluation Parameters

The clustering techniques are evaluated based on the following parameters:

1. **Silhouette Score**
2. **Calinski-Harabasz Index**
3. **Davies-Bouldin Index**

## Pre-Processing Techniques

Various pre-processing techniques are applied to the data before clustering:

Various pre-processing techniques are applied to the data before clustering:

1. **No Preprocessing:** Using the raw data without any pre-processing.
2. **Normalization:** Scaling the features to a standard range.
3. **PCA (Principle Component Analysis):** Reducing dimensionality using PCA.
4. **Transform:** Applying a transformation to the data.
5. **Scale:** Scaling the data using standard scaling.
6. **Normalization + Transformation:** Combining normalization and transformation techniques.
7. **Normalization + Transformation + PCA:** Combining normalization, transformation, and PCA techniques.

## Repository Structure

- **`notebooks/`:** Jupyter notebooks containing the code for each clustering technique and pre-processing method.
- **`data/`:** Folder containing the Iris dataset.
- **`results/`:** Folder containing the results and visualizations.
- **`README.md`:** This file providing an overview of the assignment.
